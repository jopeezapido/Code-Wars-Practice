In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Example:

filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

Required:
- List of non-negative integers with strings filtered out

What you need:
- A thing that checks whether or not each element in the array is a number
- A thing that gets the element, provided that it is a number
-
