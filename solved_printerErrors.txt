Problem:

- In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will output the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from a to z.

----------------------------------------------------------

Required:
- error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string

Input/s:
- string that will give the error rate of the printer

Output/s:
- error rate in string format representing a RATIONAL:
	**whose numerator is the number of errors and;
	**the denominator the length of the control string

Steps:
- Know the controlled string in which will be the standard.
- Create the scenarios in which the strings will be considered to have an instance of error:
	- 1st: if the inputted string contains a letter not from the range a to m.
	- 2nd: if the inputted string does not have the same pattern as the controlled string.
	- 3rd: If both of the above two errors are met.
- Know how to check the scenarios above.

Techniques/Methods/Procedures Done:
- 

Minimum Requirements:
- Pattern of correct printer error is 34111 34111 34111...
- Not necessarily case sensitive
- Letters must be ranging from a-m

What do you need:

- You need something to stand as a role model of all the given strings
	* a regular expression to set the range of letters in a string, in this case a-m
		! must return an error count once it finds a letter outside the range of a - m

- You need something to check if there is an error in the given string 
- You need something to count the length of the given string.
- You need something to count the errors found in a given string.
- You need something to make a rational number
- You need something to convert a rational number to a string.
- You need to know what to do in case where there are no errors
	* You need an if else statement

Samples:

s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
error_printer(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
error_printer(s) => "8/22"
