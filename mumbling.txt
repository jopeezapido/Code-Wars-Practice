This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum.

Note: 

The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

Required:
- A string that should only contain letters, upper case or lower case
- There is a specific space or section for each string
- First letter in the string:
	> always capitalised
	> Does not cascade (like the succeeding letters below) since it corresponds to 1, which means there is only one letter for that section
- Succeeding letters in the string:
	> Number of characters in each of the string section will cascade corresponding to the what number is the string at.
	> 1st letters of that section is always capitalised
	> Corresponding characters will be in lower case

What you need:
- Regexp to get the letters only, excluding special characters digits and spaces
- A string separator which will separate each letter of a string by a dash (-)
- Something which will put all those separated letters in lower case
- Something which will access the index of each letter of each of the array
- Something which will be the container of the separated elements
- Something which will access the elements and push them to an array of their own
- Something which will divide the strings into different arrays so that we coul
- Something which will duplicate the letter of the string in each section to the number of the position where letter is at

- Something which will capitalise the 1st letter of each of the separated string
